- [The website by HeathMitchell1 to get floodgate UUIDS from](https://floodgate-uuid.heathmitchell1.repl.co)
- [JdavisBro](https://github.com/JdavisBro) Because I ~~borrowed~~ his use of the above website to get floodgate UUIDs, specifically [around this line](https://github.com/JdavisBro/JdavisBot/blob/942ee5e9eaed0ac8a704141f82c216a4faa8c059/cogs/minecraftServer/minecraftServer.py#L57)
- [GeyserMC](https://github.com/GeyserMC) for giving me a reason to make these. I continue to use their resources on a very regular basis and I'm doing my part to be helpful to this project.
