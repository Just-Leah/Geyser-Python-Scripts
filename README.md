# Geyser Python Scripts

A small collection of geyser related python scripts to make things easier. Feel free to use any of these as examples, [I borred a bit of code from someone else anyway](https://github.com/JdavisBro/JdavisBot/blob/942ee5e9eaed0ac8a704141f82c216a4faa8c059/cogs/minecraftServer/minecraftServer.py#L57) :p

## Currently includes

- A generator that takes the gamertag of a player and makes a file with it in. I plan to make this with the ability to generate a copy paste example of adding the specified player to the `whitelist.json`
