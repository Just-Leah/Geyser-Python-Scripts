# Geyser Python Scripts

A small collection of geyser related python scripts to make things easier. Feel free to use any of these as examples, [I borrowed a bit of code from someone else anyway](https://github.com/JdavisBro/JdavisBot/blob/942ee5e9eaed0ac8a704141f82c216a4faa8c059/cogs/minecraftServer/minecraftServer.py#L57) :p

You can use `.bat` to quickly run the scripts without messing around with the command promt

## Currently includes

- A read and write `whitelist.json` parser with floodgate support for geyser.
